I am an evolutionary ecologist using theory to address global challenges in conservation. 
Below are a selection of my main research topics to date.


## the life history consequences of a terrestrial existence
I am collaborating with phylogeneticists, life-history theorists, and fisheries biologists to understand the selective forces that shape life-histories in aquatic and terrestrial environments. We have found fundamental differences in the evolution of live-birth in aquatic and terrestrial environments. These differences help to explain the relative paucity of aquatic live-bearing vertebrates and why several live-bearing terrestrial clades (e.g., sea snakes, cetaceans) have successfully colonized aquatic environments.



## a life history framework for amphibian conservation
My first postdoc with Holly Kindsvater sought to develop a life history framework for amphibian conservation. We used traditional life-history theory (r-K selection, Grimeâ€™s CSR triangle, the safe harbour hypothesis) to describe and explain the unique variation we see in amphibian reproductive strategies, with respect to the relative time spent on water vs on land. Then, by repurposing models commonly used in fisheries science, we developed a novel framework to evaluate the susceptibility of amphibians with different reproductive strategies to anthropogenic change. This framework highlights gaps in our understanding of the selective forces that have generated the tremendous diversity of amphibian life histories, and identifies species that should be prioritized for management.



## filial cannibalism in hellbenders
I am currently working in Bill Hopkins'lab investigating the population status of hellbenders in southwest Virginia. Using data from a long-term nest box study I have documented a link between the loss of riparian forest cover and rates of filial cannibalism in hellbenders and developed size-structured demographic models that incorporate individual nest fate, density dependent larval emergence, and stochastic recruitment. This research allow us to assess the current health of hellbender populations and quantify extinction risk under future management scenarios. Our models indicate that hellbenders appear to be exhibiting extinction debt across much of their range in Virginia, whereby long-lived adults persist on the landscape but the streams they inhabit no longer support sufficient recruitment for populations to persist.



## flatwoods salamander recovery
My PhD dissertation at Virginia Tech focussed on conducting a population viability analysis of flatwoods salamanders. Ultimately, this body of work informed several of the recovery criteria outlined in the recovery plan for flatwoods salamanders, and was used to develop the recovery implementation strategy. Using information on growth and survival obtained through drift fence monitoring of flatwoods salamander breeding populations, I constructed integral projection models (IPMs) to estimate extinction probabilities under different management scenarios. To build the IPM I developed growth curves, the first of their kind, that jointly model amphibian growth before and after metamorphosis (PLoS One 2020), and survival curves that account for seasonal differences in mortality (Ichthyol. Herpetol., in review). We found that population growth was most sensitive to the survival of adults in the terrestrial environment, suggesting that common forms of management (e.g., rearing larvae in cattle tanks) may be insufficient to maintain population viability. Scaling up from individual populations to the landscape level, I developed one of the first spatially-explicit metapopulation models for a pond-breeding amphibian (Aquat. Conser. 2019), and developed a protocol to guide future reintroduction efforts (PeerJ 2021).
